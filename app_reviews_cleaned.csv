HABASSI Amal;3.0;Very slow, it will take weeks sometimes to get your order, but it looks good to buy a lot of stuff at mini prices. I have so far received everything I have purchased in good condition. I don't know why I have to pay for the shipment of each piece alone, why not collect all my purchases with one shipper and then pay for once. I think you must put some kind of basket in corner to collect all, especially that they have no advantage to pay delivery drivers as they do not belong, it is Aramex ..;43;May 25, 2022
Saoussen Jebril;1.0;I have never been able to even reach the level of ordering anything. The app always freezes even if you are simply adding some items to your favorite list. I cannot stay more than one minute on it before it crushes. Instead of paying the tons of money on the adds that I see everywhere, may be you should consider improving your app.;28;August 25, 2022
Latifa Ben Amara;1.0;I used to like this app, and it was great for the first couple of months but what's really annoying is that some buyers are not serious at all! I prepare my order and give it out to delivery, it arrives to its destination and suddenly the order gets canceled because the buyer changed his/her opinion and doesn't want to buy anymore!! Or even more shocking they receive the order, proceed to damage it in the 1st 24h and then put out a complaint about the product! I suggest you find a solution ASAP;41;March 12, 2021
A Google user;1.0;A poor application, it requires a Facebook account to sign up owith any other options. Apparently there is an implicit data collection and analysis of registered people and users! Why can't you register with your email like any other app ?! Worse more, there is no clear data protection policy (at least before account creation).;25;December 16, 2019
Hend Laadhari;2.0;The app crashes every minute, it's annoying. The customer service is not always responsive and even if they do respond, the answer is vague. They also take more than 24h to release the money after the delivery even if it's not a weekend. Sometimes, the delivery takes 10 days, mostly 7 days at least.;12;June 06, 2021
Amal Mrissa;1.0;I had two buyers cancel their orders with no prior notice. They sent the order back upon a change of heart and the package returned to me untouched. Paradoxically, it's my own account that got suspended, not theirs. I can't even access my account anymore. I do not recommend using this app.;17;May 01, 2022
Farah;3.0;Great app, but the costumer service is not that great, some deliveries last a very long time and some don't even get to the buyer, mine haven't got to the buyer and it's been more than a week, the money transfer sometimes doesn't go through accordingly. I suggest you reinforce the costumer service at your company.I support this concept and whoever is behind it but please make sure your services and performances work accordingly.;4;February 09, 2021
Chayma Djaziri;2.0;So I made an order on a handbag that I absolutely loved, waited for the delivery guy two whole evenings. he didn't show up. Called him back about a 100 times always getting to aramex customer service who were no help at all. Told my mom to wait for him on another occasion, got fed up. Found out my order was canceled and now when I try to log in I get user disabled error. I know it's not your fault and you're only trying to filter unserious buyers but you need to check with your users first.;7;December 11, 2021
Maroua Marouani;1.0;The worst experience with an app in my entire life!!!!!!! Each time I need to re insert all my info like seriously?????? I had couple of things to buy then I come across the tech issue or whatever and change my mind;10;January 29, 2022
nour karoui;5.0;Besides the amazing concept and idea, they have an amazing customer service, they would take care of your order until you are satisfied. This is, by far, the best experience I've had with online shopping in Tunisia. I highly recommend it.;9;August 10, 2020
Rahma Barhoumi;1.0;Very slow and keeps crashing everytime i click on anything. Impossible to use. I do not recommend this app.;8;April 16, 2022
A Google user;4.0;Why do i need to log in only with a facebook account? Mine is deactivated for a while. This is not good. But for the website is quite good and user friendly. I didn't make any transactions until now so i can't rate that but im going to give u 4 stars for the concept;1;March 01, 2020
A Google user;1.0;I really wanted to create an account, well cause I still really find this app useful but depending on Facebook only to create an account is not the best idea like it's 2019 so many people don't use it anymore;11;September 10, 2019
Mer Yam;1.0;Very slow app ! Plus they banned me just for cancelling the item I am buying even though i was respectful and didn't scam anyone . The service and the process of selling was so slow and I am the one who called them for confirmation . They should be okay with people changing their mind since I found a better price . At least they can call me to inform me that I am being banned .;0;January 18, 2023
