the new update is bad and the app is slow and full of bugs
very bad experience with Dabchy! Really disappointed 
I had an account before and I could open the app..but here upon opening it I can't do anything and I have a blank white page
There's a problem that allows me neither to sign in nor sell. Fix the problem please
I don't have a FB account! How come there are no other options to register?
can't sign in for no reason!!!!!!!!!!
 
"One of the worst platforms you can sell in.they control you in every aspect, you can't talk to clients and not even eplain to them in the comments the worst experience is this app"
"bad Application,mediocre quality of service,I have a reclamation pending for two months !!!! And everytime I have the same answer and no useful information at all Frown_sad_andry_or_pouting I don't recommend at all!!!!"
How come I cannot sign up without Facebook ?..

"Very slow, it will take weeks sometimes to get your order, but it looks good to buy a lot of stuff at mini prices. I have so far received everything I have purchased in good condition. I don't know why I have to pay for the shipment of each piece alone, why not collect all my purchases with one shipper and then pay for once. I think you must put some kind of basket in corner to collect all, especially that they have no advantage to pay delivery drivers as they do not belong, it is Aramex .."
"The app crashes every minute, it's annoying. The customer service is not always responsive and even if they do respond, the answer is vague. They also take more than 24h to release the money after the delivery even if it's not a weekend. Sometimes, the delivery takes 10 days, mostly 7 days at least."
"Great app, but the costumer service is not that great, some deliveries last a very long time and some don't even get to the buyer, mine haven't got to the buyer and it's been more than a week, the money transfer sometimes doesn't go through accordingly. I suggest you reinforce the costumer service at your company.I support this concept and whoever is behind it but please make sure your services and performances work accordingly."
"So I made an order on a handbag that I absolutely loved, waited for the delivery guy two whole evenings. he didn't show up. Called him back about a 100 times always getting to aramex customer service who were no help at all. Told my mom to wait for him on another occasion, got fed up. Found out my order was canceled and now when I try to log in I get user disabled error. I know it's not your fault and you're only trying to filter unserious buyers but you need to check with your users first."
Why do i need to log in only with a facebook account? Mine is deactivated for a while. This is not good. But for the website is quite good and user friendly. I didn't make any transactions until now so i can't rate that but im going to give u 4 stars for the concept
The service is amazing but the problem is the order take so much time to reach out this very slowly hope you fix this prob
the app is slow and the upload option is so bad it keeps reducing the image quality.
why do you require sign-up via Facebook? i just want to check the articles and that shouldn't require an account. at least add sign-up via Google
Great service idea. Only applied rate is too high.
All I see is female stuff. The description is literally saying buy and sell clothes from home... The filter only allows you to see female's or kid's clothes 🤔
"Just missing a male version , besides , it's great"
"good trustable platform , some great deals ❤️"
It seems a good app but! Where's the mens fashion? just for women girls and boys
i don't have Facebook ! there should be more ways to log in like by email or phone number !
You should consider more than Facebook registration for signing-up!!
i lost my account
is it only for females?
the procedure is so slow
very slow app
"great app with great opportunies! Although, the delivery takes some time"
good
does it work with a current postal bank account?
"I like this app and the concept, but I am disappointed because Dabchy is only destined for kids and women"
"Hey I like the app, but Problem is it doesn't want to open from the app it always takes me to chrome and it opens from there through Facebook!! Help please"
"The prices are a bit high but sometimes there are great deals also the app takes 10% of the items you're selling and it sucks ,not bad tho for a tunisian online thrift shop "
I just installed the app fulfilled everything required and I tapped 'je vend' but didn't get any notification if my product has already been published or nothing has been shown to so plz tell me if something is wrong or something is missing thx
bad application. Full of technical problems. 
  
"the idea is amazing but you have to add a ""men"" category"
